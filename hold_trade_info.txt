In case you want to have SOME of the trades to only be sold when on profit, add a file named
"nfi-hold-trades.json" in the user_data directory

The contents should be similar to:

{"trade_ids": [1, 3, 7], "profit_ratio": 0.005}

Or, for individual profit ratios(Notice the trade ID's as strings:

{"trade_ids": {"1": 0.001, "3": -0.005, "7": 0.05}}

NOTE:
* trade_ids is a list of integers, the trade ID's, which you can get from the logs or from the
output of the telegram status command.
* Regardless of the defined profit ratio(s), the strategy MUST still produce a SELL signal for the HOLD support logic to run
* This feature can be completely disabled with the holdSupportEnabled class attribute

-------- SPECIFIC PAIRS

In case you want to have some pairs to always be on held until a specific profit, using the same
"hold-trades.json" file add something like:

{"trade_pairs": {"BTC/USDT": 0.001, "ETH/USDT": -0.005}}

-------- SPECIFIC TRADES AND PAIRS It is also valid to include specific trades and pairs on the holds file, for example:

{"trade_ids": {"1": 0.001}, "trade_pairs": {"BTC/USDT": 0.001}}
